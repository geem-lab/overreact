Contributing
============

Thank you for considering contributing to overreact!

Support questions
-----------------

Please don't use the issue tracker for asking questions.
Use the `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/overreact>`__ for
questions about your own code or the use of overreact.

You can also send me an e-mail. I'm more than happy to answer any personal or
in-depth questions about overreact. Feel free to email schneider.felipe@posgrad.ufsc.br.

Reporting issues
----------------

The easiest way to get help with the project is to `open an issue on Github
<http://github.com/geem-lab/overreact/issues>`__:

- Describe what you expected to happen.
- If possible, include a `minimal reproducible example <https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example>`__
  to help us identify the issue.
  This also helps check that the issue is not with your own code.
- Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an
  exception.
- List your Python version, as well as other packages.
  If possible, check if this issue is not already fixed in the repository.

Submitting patches
------------------

- Use `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/>`__ to autoformat your code.
- Use `Numpydoc docstrings <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`__
  to document your code.
- Include tests if your patch is supposed to solve a bug, and explain clearly
  under which circumstances the bug happens.
  Make sure the test fails without your patch.
- Include a string like “Fixes #123” in your commit message (where 123 is the
  issue you fixed).
  See `Closing issues using keywords <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`__.
- Use `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`__.
