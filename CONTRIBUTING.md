# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the development of **overreact**, you can find the
source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/geem-lab/overreact). The recommended
way of contributing is by forking the repository and pushing your changes to the
forked repository.

> **💡** If you're interested in contributing to open-source projects, make sure
> to read
> [“How to Contribute to Open Source”](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
> from [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) They may even have a
> translation for your native language!

We use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to develop the project, so first make sure it's installed.

After cloning your fork, run:

```console
$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:your-username/overreact.git # your-username is your GitHub username
$ cd overreact
$ uv sync --all-extras
```

Before submitting any pull requests, make sure all tests pass with:

```console
$ uv run pytest
```

## Recommended practices

### Reporting issues

The easiest way to report a bug or request a feature is to
[create an issue on GitHub](http://github.com/geem-lab/overreact/issues). The
following greatly enhances our ability to solve the issue you are experiencing:

- Before anything, check if we haven't fixed your issue already in the repository
  by searching for similar issues in the
  [issue tracker](http://github.com/geem-lab/overreact/issues).
- Describe what you were doing when the error occurred, what
  happened, and what you expected to see.
  Also, include the full [traceback](https://realpython.com/python-traceback/) if
  there was an exception.
- Tell us the Python version you're using, as well as the versions of
  overreact (and other packages you might be using with it).
- **Please consider including a
  [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
  to help us identify the issue.** This also helps check that the issue is not
  with your own code.

### Asking questions

Use the [discussions](https://github.com/geem-lab/overreact/discussions) for
questions about your own code or on the use of overreact. (Please don't use the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/geem-lab/overreact/issues) for asking
questions, the discussions are a better place to ask questions 😄.)

### Submitting patches

- Include tests if your patch solves a bug, and explain clearly
  under which circumstances the bug happens. Make sure the test fails without
  your patch.
- Use [ruff format](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) to auto-format your code.
- Use [ruff check](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/) to check for code quality issues.
- Use
  [Numpydoc documentation strings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
  to document your code.
- Include a string like “fixes #123” in your commit message (where 123 is the
  issue you fixed). See
  [Closing issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
- Bump version according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
