**overreact** is a _library_ and a _command-line tool_ for creating and
analyzing [microkinetic models](https://geem-lab.github.io/overreact-docs/#microkinetic).
Data is parsed directly from computational chemistry output files thanks to
[`cclib`](https://cclib.github.io/) (see the [list of supported programs](https://cclib.github.io/#summary)).

## Installation

**overreact** is a Python package, so you can easily install it with `pip`.
