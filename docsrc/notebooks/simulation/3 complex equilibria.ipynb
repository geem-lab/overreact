    "## Complex equilibria\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accurately represent complex equilibria, equilibrium constants and, consequently, binding free energies must be accurately calculated. This tutorial summarizes the important points that need to be addressed, mainly based on [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1039/C5CP00628G). We are going to assume water as solvent, but results are applicable with minor changes to any solvent.\n",

    "where $G^\\circ_\\text{aq}(\\ce{X})$ is the absolute free energy of molecule X, which encompasses the electronic energy, rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator (RRHO) energy and solvation free energy, and contains the zero point energy through te RRHO approximation. The standard state ($^\\circ$) is assumed to be 1 M.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's nowadays very common to do fully solvated electronic calculations, without the use of thermodynamic cycles. Furthermore, it's very important to take dispersion, and three-body dispersion in particular, into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most electronic structure codes (such as ORCA) compute RRHO energy corrections for ideal gases, for which the standard state is a pressure of 1 bar (or sometimes 1 atm). In order to correct gas phase free energies, the following transformation is applied\n",

    "overreact assumes that each molecular structure is a different entity, which means that conformers and acid-base related structures should be explicity included.

You can always calculate the final apparent equilibrium constant from the final simulated populations.\n",

    "Solvation must be accurately treated with a proper solvation method such as SMD, which is perfectly fine for optimizing geometries. Also bear in mind that the addition of explicit water molecules, specially around ionic sites, can improve binding free energies. (Besides, with methods such as XTB and Crest, there's no excuse to not do conformational searches or find optimum interaction structures for explicit waters nowadays.)\n",
