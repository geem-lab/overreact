    "But, since systematic errors might cancel out, and energies contributing to reaction rate constants are always deltas, the error estimate above might be high for any decent level of theory and correct physics (i.e. good solvation estimates, eletronic errors, harmonic approximation, etc.). Thus, in order to obtain reaction rate constants within 10% of their \"true\" value, we would need systematic errors to be within\n",

    "But even after all physics was taken into account and good methodologies were employed, systematic error might still exist. A simple and effective way of overcoming systematic errors is by simply estimating the systematic error. If a kinetic experiment providing concentrations of one or more components over time is available, then the systematic error can be fitted as a constant that multiplies all reaction rate constants of the reaction scheme\n",
